        <h3>That's right! The best replacement for a child that someone could have is a cat. On this site you will find a multitude of facts, information, and resources to aid you in your child-replacement journey. You will also be introduced to my own pride and joys: Gaston, Kylo, and Nubs. I hope that by providing you with this information and three examples of the best of the best, I can convince you that what you don't need is a child. What you need...is a cat.</h3>

     <h3>The Origin of Cats</h3>
            <p>If you are looking for the existance of God, there is no better place to look than cats. Cats are the purest form of divine creation put into the universe. It is often believed in Christian theory that humans were made in the image of God himself, however this is not true. God's true image comes in the form of the mammal family felidae. The fact that humans were able to tame and domesticate felidae was a gift from God himself, equivilant to the sacrifice he made by sending his only son Lord Jesus to bare the weight of humanity's sins.</p>

        <h3>The Anti-Cat Hate Mob and Their Rhetoric</h3>
        <img src="https://www.therange.co.uk/media/9/4/1648642277_12_9679.jpg" alt="BadPeople">
            <p>Most members of the Anti-Cat Mob are horrifically wrong about cats. Not only do they spread the lies and rhetoric mentioned above (and more not mentioned in that list), but they advocate for the abuse of cats. To them, cats are not worthy of love and affection the same way dogs are. They deserve to be left behind to fend for themselves, or to be physically and emotionally abused for mistakes or for simply being cats. Going through the kinds of things these people say about cats are horrific! And righ now, there is a growing group of individuals who aim to seek out and actively abuse, torture, and maim these precious beings.</p>

        <h3>Dogs Are Not Your Best Friend</h3>
        <img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/89/205098923_19b864ee9d_z.jpg" alt="Devil">
                  <p>Listen, all I'm saying is that I've never heard of someone's child getting mauled to death by a cat. I'm not even trying to out specific dog breeds that get far too much hate! Any dog can maul a child or smaller animal.</p>
                  <p>Dogs do not have some kind of moral superiority over cats. They aren't more capable of love or loyalty. They don't understand you differently. They aren't cleaner than cats and they certainly aren't nicer.</p>
                  <P>If you are a die-hard dog fan, that's fine. Just don't try and murder my cats just because you think they're below sentient.</P>
