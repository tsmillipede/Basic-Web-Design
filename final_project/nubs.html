        <h3>Nubs's Story</h3>
        <p>Nubs was one of the kittens in a litter a cat my partner's family used to own had. She was the only one they kept, and they named her Nubscout because she was born with no tail. She's been with them for nearly 9 years and she will continue to be with them for many more.</p>

        <h3>Nubs's Personality</h3>
        <p>Nubs is an old little lady whose meow sounds like she's been smoking 2 packs a day for 20 years. She does not like any other cat besides Kylo, and even then she still beats him up constantly. The only people she loves are me and my partner, but even then her patience is limited. She can be very affectionate and playful, but other times she can be very rude.</p>
