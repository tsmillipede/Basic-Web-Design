        <h2>About Kylo</h2>
        <h3>Age: 6</h3>
        <h3>Breed: American Shorthair</h3>
        <h3>Favorite Activities: Kylo loves being a freak and staring at people. He takes forever to warm up to people and if he doesn't recognize someone's voice he hides. He makes stupid faces and is ugly.</h3>
        <h3>Kylo's Story</h3>
        <p>Kylo was found on the streets when he was just a kitten. My partner's extended family took him in before eventually giving it to my partner's direct family. Kylo was named after Kylo Ren, however there is zero simularities between personalities. Kylo lives with Nubs, and they have a love/hate relationship.</p>

        <h3>Kylo's Personality</h3>
