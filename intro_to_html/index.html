<h2> How Do I Know Who To Vote For?</h2>
<p>There are many ways to find information on the presidential candidates. Unless you follow the election very closely throughout the entire process, you only need to spend time researching the two primary candidates for our country's two main political parties. These parties are the Democratic and Republican parties. You might also see them called the blue and red parties respectively and the members referred to as Democrats and Republicans. The Republican Party is also often called the GOP. In terms of mascots, the Democratic Party is represented by a donkey, and the Republican Party is represented by an elephant. </p>

<p>The easiest way to make your decision is by researching the two primary candidates. Policies and backgrounds are especially important, as they may reflect your personal values and beliefs. It is tradition for the candidates to have 2 scheduled debates hosted by different news sources, so watching those is an excellent way to see and hear the candidates talk about their ideas and policies. You might also want to tune into the Democratic and Republican National Conventions. There, the candidates and significant party members will give speeches also detailing that party's values. 
<h3>The first debate scheduled for the current presidential candidates is September 10th, 2024.</h3>
<p>Of course, the best way is for you to do your own personal resarch outside of news sources and media outlets. There are many sources that will provide unbiased facts and information about every candidate.</p>
